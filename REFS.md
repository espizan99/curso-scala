#### Books

[_Functional programming in Scala_](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). One of the best books for learning functional programming. As an added bonus, Scala is used throughout the book. 

[_Learn you a Haskell for Great Good_](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). A book on functional programming in Haskell, well known for its clarity of exposition.

[_Scala Design Patterns_](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-02192-8). A translation to Scala of the popular object-oriented patterns, plus a section dedicated to functional programming patterns. 

[Advanced Scala with Scalaz](http://underscore.io/books/advanced-scala-scalaz/). Small book on some of the main type classes included in the scalaz library. 


#### Presentations

[_Functional talks_](http://functionaltalks.org). A curated collection of talks and presentations that exclusively focus on functional programming topics. Programming languages: Haskell, Scala, Clojure, etc. 

[_An invitation to functional programming_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa7jh1J4xNs). An introductory talk on functional programming, by one of the authors of "Functional programming in Scala".

[_The Interpreter Pattern Revisited_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmX2s3pe_qk). Good talk showing the links between object-oriented patterns and functional programming.

[_Functional Programming is Terrible_](http://functionaltalks.org/2014/03/31/runar-oli-bjarnason-functional-programming-is-terrible/). Things that must be taken into account when using Scala for functional programming in production environments.

[_What Have the Monads Ever Done for Us?_](http://www.typesafe.com/resources/video/what-have-the-monads-ever-done-for-us) Introductory talk on monads.

[_Scala Typeclassopedia with John Kodumal_](youtube.com/watch?v=IMGCDph1fNY). The typeclassopedia (functors, monads, and so forth), translated into Scala.

[_Scalaz presentation_](http://functionaltalks.org/2013/05/27/nick-partridge-scalaz). Very nice introduction to the Scalaz library.

[_Functional Programming with Scalaz_](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2130-talk-by-jason-zaugg). Another great introduction to Scalaz, this time by its major contributor.

#### Blogs

[_Higher Order. Philosophy and functional programming_](http://blog.higher-order.com/). Advanced content on functional programming. 

[_Underscore.IO blog_](http://underscore.io/blog/). Basic and intermediate content on functional programming and Scala. You'll find there some nice posts, such as this one on purely functional [error handling](http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2015/02/23/designing-fail-fast-error-handling.html) in Scala.

[_The Neophyte's Guide to Scala_](http://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html). Introductory guide to some Scala features and design patterns (pattern matching, type classes and so forth). 

[_Bartosz Milewski's Programming Cafe. Concurrency, C++, Haskell, Category Theory_](http://bartoszmilewski.com/). Advanced content on functional programming and category theory. One of the best sources to learn category theory, BTW.

[_Haskell for all_](http://www.haskellforall.com/). Despite its name, this blog is mostly about functional programming rather than haskell.

[_School of Haskell_](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/). Again, this is about haskell, and henceforth about functional programming. Great post on [free monads](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html).

[_A Neighborhood of Infinity_](http://blog.sigfpe.com/). One of the best blogs on functional programming, using Haskell. Great article on monads: [_You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have.)_](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html)

[_THIS IS MY BLOG (Tim Perret)_](http://timperrett.com/index.html). This blog is mainly referenced by its introduction to [free monads](http://timperrett.com/2013/11/21/free-monads-part-1/) (in Scala).

#### Conferences

[_Lambda world_](http://lambda.world). The premier conference of functional programming for the software practitioner (at least in Spain ;). [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBcDOjv-bhAmLavY71RMHA/feed).

[_Scala exchange_](http://scala.exchange). One of the most popular conferences for the Scala programming language. Based on UK.

[_Scaladays_](http://www.scaladays.org). The mother of all Scala conferences. 

[_Scala world_](http://www.scala.world). A recent conference on Scala.

#### Papers

[_Why Functional Programming Matters_](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html). One of the best motivations for functional programming, even if monads were still in its infancy at the time of its writing. 

[_The essence of functional programming_](http://www.eliza.ch/doc/wadler92essence_of_FP.pdf). This paper revolves around monads and its role within purely functional programming.

#### Other sources

[_Scala syntax_](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html). Summary of Scala for Java programmers.

[_Haskell wiki_](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell). The haskell wiki, a great source to steal functional programming concepts and apply them to Scala. For instance, you'll find there the [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia).

[_Scala exercises_](http://scala-exercises.47deg.com/index.html). A collection of small exercises for different Scala features. 

[_Infoq_](http://www.infoq.com). A popular tech portal with a good coverage on [functional programming](http://www.infoq.com/fp/), [Scala](http://www.infoq.com/scala/) and [Spark](http://www.infoq.com/spark).
